Monthly Travel Requirement

Dear,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to respectfully request that the monthly travel requirement to the work site be waived. 

I am fully committed to continuing my work and contributing effectively, and I am willing to accept any modest salary without the expectation of promotion. 

However, due to my family responsibilities, including the care of my daughter and other dependents, I kindly request that monthly travel to the work location be exempted.

I am confident that I can maintain and improve my productivity while working remotely. 

I am fully equipped to work efficiently from home and ensure that there will be no disruption to the team or ongoing projects.

I sincerely appreciate your understanding and support as I navigate this important time in my family life. 

Thank you very much for your time and thoughtful consideration of this request.

Kind regards,
